Useless Box

A useless box is basically a machine which turns itself off. However, with a few additional servos, and a little programming, you're able to blow some live into it and give it some "character" - as well as adding a few surprises for the user...
TL;DR

A demo video of the box. Because of randomization the video doesn't include all different behavior patterns - there are more...

Features / Surprises

    Control the door and "hand" separately
    Detect the operator by using a distance sensor
    Wave a white flag
    Hop away
    Ambient light

I've used software debouncing of the switch because it's much easier than including additional wiring and parts. Although the MotorShield is clearly overkill for this project it reduces the complexity of the required electronics knowledge (and soldering) quite a bit.

    Wooden box with enough space to fit everything into
    Some chipboard ~ 4mm to build the arm and mountings
    Rubber band to force-close the lid
    Hinges
    Cables

Tools

    Solder
    Jigsaw
    Sanding paper
    Wood glue

Operation

My useless box fulfills of course the basic functionality of turning itself off. But using a few additional pieces of equipment it can:

    "Hop" away
    Detect the users distance (and react to it)
    Wave a white flag - but without giving up of course :)

Software

The box has basically a fixed set of "moves" it can do to turn of the switch after it has been turned on. To make things a little more interesting, the moves are randomly used to surprise the operator.

The whole code is quite easy - there's nothing special about it. I've created a few bases classes to control every peripheral and another class "Moves" to implement the patterns. This is mainly because the basic Arduino way of programming leads to lots of code duplication and unreadable code.
